🤖 RAG Engine AI Assistant
Let me help you choose the perfect configuration!

Hi! I'm your personal RAG Engine consultant. I'll help you choose the perfect 
stack configuration based on your needs.

Let me ask you a few questions to get started:

1. What's your main use case?
   a) Quick demo (showing friends/colleagues)
   b) Local development and experimentation
   c) Production deployment
   d) Research and academic work
   e) Embedded/minimal system

What sounds like your situation?

> a

Great choice! Demo setups need to be fast and reliable. A few follow-up questions:

2. Where will you be doing this demo?
   - At home with good internet
   - At a friend's house (unknown internet)
   - At a conference/meeting
   - Completely offline

> At a friend's house (unknown internet)

Perfect! For demos at unknown locations, I recommend the DEMO stack because:

✅ Works completely offline (no internet required)
✅ Small download (~200MB vs 1GB+ for full setups)
✅ Fast installation (5 minutes vs 20+ minutes)
✅ Uses lightweight local models (phi3.5 or llama3.2)
✅ All core features work (document upload, Q&A, chat)

3. How comfortable are you with technical setup?
   a) Very comfortable (I love terminals and config files)
   b) Somewhat comfortable (I can follow instructions)
   c) Not comfortable (I prefer one-click solutions)

> c

Excellent! For you, I recommend:

🎯 **RECOMMENDED SETUP: Windows One-Click + DEMO Stack**

This will:
1. Run `ai_setup.bat` (this script!)
2. Auto-install Ollama + phi3.5 model
3. Install minimal Python dependencies
4. Configure everything automatically
5. Open the demo in your browser

Total time: ~5 minutes
Internet required: Only for initial download
Demo works: Completely offline

Would you like me to proceed with this setup?

> yes

🚀 Installing DEMO stack...

[Installation progress...]

✅ DEMO stack installed successfully!

🎉 **You're all set!** Here's what's ready:

- Local LLM: phi3.5 (2GB, fast responses)
- Web UI: http://localhost:3001
- Sample documents: Loaded and ready
- Offline capable: No internet needed for demos

💡 **Demo flow suggestion:**
1. Upload a document (try the sample demo_document.md)
2. Ask questions about it
3. Show the dark/light theme toggle
4. Explain how it works without internet

🤖 **I'm still here to help!** You can ask me anything:

Examples:
- "How do I add my own documents?"
- "What if someone asks about the technology?"
- "How do I make responses faster?"
- "Can I switch to cloud APIs later?"

Type your question or 'exit' to finish:

> How do I add my own documents?

Great question! There are several ways to add documents:

📁 **Method 1: Web UI (Easiest)**
1. Open http://localhost:3001
2. Go to "Documents" tab
3. Click "Upload" and select your files
4. Supported: .txt, .pdf, .docx, .md

📁 **Method 2: File Drop**
1. Copy files to the `documents/` folder
2. Restart the backend: `python -m rag_engine serve`
3. Files will be automatically processed

📁 **Method 3: CLI**
```bash
rag-engine add-document path/to/your/file.pdf
```

💡 **Pro tips:**
- Smaller files (< 1MB) work best for demos
- Plain text and markdown are fastest to process
- PDFs take longer but work great
- Try uploading a company policy, research paper, or manual
