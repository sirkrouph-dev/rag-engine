This is a test document for the RAG engine. 

The RAG engine is a modular framework for building Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipelines. It supports multiple document types including PDF, TXT, DOCX, and HTML files.

Key features include:
- Document loading with multiple file format support
- Text chunking with various strategies
- Multiple embedding providers like OpenAI and HuggingFace
- Vector databases including FAISS, ChromaDB, and Pinecone
- Advanced retrieval strategies
- LLM integration for response generation

The system uses configuration files to define all aspects of the pipeline, making it highly customizable and easy to experiment with different components.

Installation is simple with pip install requirements. The system supports both CLI and API interfaces for different use cases.

This document serves as a test to verify that the RAG pipeline can successfully load, chunk, embed, and retrieve information from text documents.
