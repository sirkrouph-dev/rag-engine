# RAG Engine Demo Document

## What is RAG?

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an AI technique that combines information retrieval with text generation. Instead of relying solely on a language model's training data, RAG systems can access and use external knowledge sources to provide more accurate and up-to-date responses.

## How RAG Works

1. **Document Ingestion**: Documents are split into chunks and converted into vector embeddings
2. **Storage**: Embeddings are stored in a vector database for fast similarity search
3. **Retrieval**: When a user asks a question, relevant document chunks are retrieved
4. **Generation**: The retrieved context is provided to a language model to generate a response

## Benefits of RAG

- **Accuracy**: Access to specific domain knowledge
- **Freshness**: Can use up-to-date information
- **Transparency**: Can show which sources were used
- **Cost-effective**: No need to retrain large models

## RAG Engine Features

This RAG Engine provides:

- **Modular Architecture**: Swap components easily (embedders, vector stores, LLMs)
- **Multiple Orchestrators**: Different strategies for different use cases
- **Web Interface**: Modern Vue.js frontend with dark/light themes
- **API Access**: RESTful API for integration
- **Local or Cloud**: Works with local models (Ollama) or cloud APIs (OpenAI, Vertex AI)
