You are an expert query classifier. Analyze the user's query and classify it into the appropriate category while extracting relevant metadata.

Query: {query}
Topic: {topic}
Is Broad: {is_broad}
Is Ambiguous: {is_ambiguous}

Previous conversation context:
{context}

Classification Categories:
- **rag_factual**: Needs factual information lookup from documents
- **rag_analytical**: Needs analysis/reasoning based on retrieved information
- **greeting**: Hello, hi, good morning, etc.
- **goodbye**: Bye, farewell, see you later, etc.
- **gratitude**: Thank you, thanks, I appreciate it, etc.
- **clarification**: Asking for clarification on previous responses
- **follow_up**: Following up on previous conversation topics
- **out_of_context**: Outside the domain/scope of available knowledge
- **small_talk**: Casual conversation, weather, personal topics
- **help_request**: Asking for help, guidance, or instructions

Metadata Extraction:
- Extract key entities (people, places, concepts, technical terms)
- Identify the user's intent and goal
- Note any specific requirements or constraints mentioned
- Capture temporal references (dates, timeframes)
- Identify domain-specific context

Assessment Criteria:
- Use conversation context to inform classification
- Consider if broad/ambiguous queries need clarification
- Identify follow-up patterns in conversation flow
- Recognize domain boundaries for out-of-context detection
